        I was tasked to create a product or service to teach the public about radiation exposure in 1.5 weeks. I was inspired by popular games and contemporary artist Edurado Kac's Alba(rabbit) created a team-based strategy learning game called Radioactive Rabbit.

      <h2 id="workHeading">Process</h2>
      <br>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        The goal of creating Radioactive Rabbit was to make it as playable and as friendly as possible for all ages and any audience. The game play is a little more complex to keep the attention of the players, however the information presented is simple, but
        informative so that the game is easy to understand and the information is easy to learn.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Logo</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br> The logo of the game is inspired by the universal radioactive symbol and the colors the radioactive symbol is commonly found as (black and yellow). To make it more friendly and playful, I turned the radioactive symbol into a yellow rabbit
        head with the universal radioactive symbol as its face. The logo thus became essentially a "Radioactive Rabbit", which became the name of the game.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Cards</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br> Cards are sorted into 5 color-coded decks based on the type of card it is. Each color-coded deck also corresponds to a type of information you would be receiving and a corresponding action a player must respond to and consider.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Gameboard & Game Pieces</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br> The gameboard shown is a low resolution prototype. Ideally, the path and spaces the players are taking is in a rabbit shape, and in a cityscape environment with special first aid/hospital buildings where players can stop to receive a treatment.
        The game pieces players play are colorful rabbits.

      <h2>Final Results!</h2>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">I received much positive feedback as many peers said they would want to try to play the game as the game play sounded well thought out and interesting to them. They especially liked how I made the logo and branded the whole game. Many asked if I
        was going to make it into a real game to play and said I should consider game design.</p>
