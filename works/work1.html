      <h2 id="workHeading">Process</h2>
      <br>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        The City of Davis wanted a specially designed wayfinding system for their cycling and pedestrian pathways around City of Davis. Designing a wayfinding system for cyclists and pedestrians was important to the City of Davis because (fun fact) there are
        more bikes than cars in Davis, and more cyclists and pedestrians than cars on the road in Davis.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Prototype 1</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br> I really wanted to embody Davis and what Davis is know for, which is being a small, sustainable, and agricultural city. Initially, I wanted to create the wayfinding system as something quirky and different by playing with different shapes
        and farm animal mascots to differentiate the different signs.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Feedback & Reframing</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br>However, upon feedback from peers, I noticed it too many things were trying to be done. I took a step back reframed and refocused my designs into something more simple, concise, and easy to understand rather than make it too out-of-the-box and elaborate.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Research</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br> I decided to do some more research by walking to area and observe the area to see what
        the experience was like for cyclists and pedestrians that go through this route daily. I approached several pedestrians and cyclists passing by and aapproached them for an interview. I asked them several questions about the current
        wayfinding system for cyclists and pedestrians around Davis they liked and disliked and what characteristics they would look for in a successful wayfinding system.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Findings</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br>I received very valuable feedback. Based on the most common reply I received, a green color seemed most appropriate pedestrians and cyclists already associated the color green with cyclist and pedestrian wayfinding because pre-existing wayfinding signs around Davis are already a green color. Many would also like more signs that marked that they were still on the cyclist and pedestrian routes and more signs that reinforced the idea that the roads are to be shared.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Final Product</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br>I still wanted to make the signs unique and different, so I decided to go with simple shapes, but make the signs stand out with the graphic design and how the informations is being presented on the sign itself.

      <h2 id="workHeading">Final Results!</h2>
      <br>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc"> After taking into consideration all the research, feedback, and design principles for information design, I was able to refine and create a clean, simple, elegant, and cohesive sign system for the City of Davis was that would be cost efficient,
        and easy to implement Davisâ€™s pre-existing architecture and landscape, and complement the natural environment and feel of what is Davis.
