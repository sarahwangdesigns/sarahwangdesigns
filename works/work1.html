    <h2 id="workHeading">Project Brief</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
      In a design team of 4, including myself, we were tasked to design an interactive vinyl design based on a location and its respective environment located in the UC Davis Campus. After exploring the campus to see what buildings and inspirations might come our way, the location my team chose to spice up was the engineering building, Everson Hall, because UC Davis's iconic Coffee Lab was located here, and because we were all coffee enthusiasts.
      <br>
      <br>
      We scouted out the building and was further inspired by the natural environment one of the building's exisiting entrances. We decided we would ultize the entrance and what the building is known for, and come up with a phrase to make a vinyl design out of that would signify the building. In addition, we were inspired to make a makeshift coffee cup including handle by the protruding stone shelter and a gradient steam trail above our coffee cup inspired by the vents on the building walls. These details would further help pull together our overall idea and vinyl design.
    </p>

  <div id="workDesc2">
    <h2 id="workTitle">Process</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
    We took pictures of the environment and began photoshopping possible designs onto the pictures. We had to decide what our vinyl design should say, the font and type we will use, and how it should look on entrance doors. In addition, we started drafting what color the coffee cup should be, where and how the handle of the cup should look, and how we would go about adding more rectangles to make the prexisting square cut outs on the building wall look like a gradient to better represent steam.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Vinyls, Vinyls, Vinyls</h4>
      <br>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
      We researched many coffee related phrases online that best suited the overall look and feeling we wanted our design to convey. After asking our peers who are advid coffee consumers as well, the phrase "Wake Up and Smell the Coffee" ended up best sending a calming and positive message to people who would interact and/or relate to the design the most. We decided to go with a mix of a sans serif textured thick weight font and a handwritten cursive font to represent the grounded coffee and the smooth taste of a good cup of fresh brewed coffee. Our vinyl design was printed on black vinyl by mistake originally and would not match well with our design, so we decided to spray paint the design with gold paint. It ended up working great as it represented the idea of coffee even better as coffee packaging contained gold foil lettering/print often, further pulling our design together.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Cup</h4>
        <br>
        <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        We decided to contruct the cup with duct tape and cardboard. We decided to use colored duct tape to create a coffee cup shape because removing duct tape from the cement and stone surfaces later would not only be the cheapest method, but duct tape would also be the easiest removal with least residue left behind in the environment. We chose an orange duct tape because orange would pop but still be a color related to coffee as we observed many coffee packaging contained the color orange and most people we talked to also agreed that out of all colors that would pop out, orange reminded them of coffee the most. We went with a matte orange duct tape that we specially ordered rather than a fluorescent and shiny orange duct tape because we did not want our design to look like a construction zone. The cup handle was the most important part to making the entrance look like a coffee cup and pull our design overall together.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Steamy</h4>
          <br>
          <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
          We decided to make it look like steam is coming out of our coffee cup by creating gradient grayscale rows of squares continuing off from the already pre-existing rectangle cut outs already on the wall. We photoshopped an image of the emvironment with gradient squares to decide how each shade of gray should look like. After, we decided to climb up and measure one of the rectangle cut outs above the entrance to the best of our abilities so that our squares would best blend and match the environement. We then printed our grayscale squares on paper.
