    <br>
    <br>
    <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
      In a design team of 4, including myself, we were tasked to design an interactive vinyl design that would form a narrative about what a building's enviornment was like inside while generating a reaction from users and observers of the building and utilizing its pre-existing archetectural environment to build upon the narrative.
      <br>
      <br>
    The concept for our design installation centers around the coffee lab located in Everson Hall. Everson Hall is the location of the textiles department, but we wanted to focus on the coffee lab because itâ€™s a lesser-known feature of campus.

  <div id="workDesc2">
    <h2 id="workTitle">Process</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
    We took pictures of the environment and began photoshopping possible designs onto the pictures to get a look and feel of the design we had in mind.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Vinyls</h4>
      <br>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
      We researched many coffee related phrases online that best suited the overall look and feeling we wanted our design to convey. After asking our peers who are advid coffee consumers as well, the phrase "Wake Up and Smell the Coffee" ended up best sending a calming and positive message to people who would interact and/or relate to the design the most. We chose the typefaces Steelworks Vintage Demo and SignPainter because we wanted the typography to have an old-fashioned
feel of a local coffee shop. Our vinyl design was spray painted gold paint to stand out from the dark doorway and reflected metallic details often found on coffee bags.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Cup</h4>
        <br>
        <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        We decided to construct the cup with duct tape and cardboard. We decided to use colored duct tape to create a coffee cup outline on the archway of the entrance because removing duct tape from the cement and stone surfaces later would be the cheapest method and easiest to remove later with least residue left behind in the environment. We specifically chose a matte orange color for the duct tape because the bright color would draw attention to the installation and orange is a color that is used in coffee packaging. Most people we talked to also agreed that out of all colors that would pop out, orange reminded them of coffee the most. The cup handle was made of recycled cardboard and we used the left over orange duct tape to mask the cup handle.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Steam</h4>
          <br>
          <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
          We decided to a steam trail coming from the coffee cup by creating gradient grayscale rows of squares continuing off from the already pre-existing rectangle cut outs already on the wall. We photoshopped an image of the environment with gradient squares to decide how each shade of gray should look like. After, we decided to climb up and measure one of the rectangle cut outs above the entrance to the best of our abilities so that our squares would best blend and match the environement. We then printed our grayscale squares on paper.

    <p id="aboutWorkDesc">The final results turned out great as it did catch positive attention of people passing by it, especially one of the professors that teaches the coffee lab course, was thrilled to see our installation and enjoyed it very much.</p>
