      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        The City of Davis provided a prompt to help the City of Davis design a wayfinding system for their cycling and pedestrian pathways around City of Davis. Designing a wayfinding system for cyclists and pedestrians was important to the City of Davis because (fun fact) there are more bikes than cars in Davis, and more cyclists and pedestrians than cars on the road in Davis.
      </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Prototype 1</h4>
          <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
            <br> I really wanted to embody Davis and what Davis is know for, which is being a small, sustainable, and agricultural city. Initially, I wanted to create the wayfinding system as something quirky and different by playing with different shapes and farm animal mascots to differentiate the different signs.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Realization</h4>
          <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
            <br>However, upon feedback from peers, I noticed it too many things were trying to be done. I took a step back and asked myself, “what is the most important thing for people when they’re moving, on the go, and only have a few seconds to a few minutes to digest what information a sign is trying to convey?”, and I realized I needed to reframe and refocus on the idea that the most important characteristics of a successful wayfinding sign is that it needs to be clear, concise, and simple.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Pivot</h4>
          <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
            <br> I decided to do some more research and scout the area I was assigned to create signs for. I approached several people and asked them several questions about the wayfinding system for pedestrians and cyclists around Davis and what characteristics they would look for in a successful wayfinding system, and received very valuable feedback such as: clean icons and arrows would be useful, a color they would associate a wayfinding system for cyclists and pedestrians around Davis would be a green color (because pre-existing wayfinding signs around Davis are already a green color), and that there should be signs to mark that they are still on the path for cyclists and pedestrians. I decided to go with simple shapes, but make the signs stand out with the graphic design and how the informations is being presented on the sign itself.

    <div id="workDesc3">
      <h2>Final Results!</h2>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">After taking into consideration all the research, feedback, and design principles for information design, I was able to create a clean, simple, modern, and cohesive sign system for the City of Davis was that would be cost efficient, and easy to implement Davis’s pre-existing architecture and landscape, and complement the natural environment and feel of what is Davis.
