        I was tasked to create a product or service that would teach the public about a public health issue. The public health issue I chose to tackle was creating an outlet for college students, specifically UC Davis college students, to more openly discuss
        and communicate safe sex practices.

      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        Initially, I thought the reason why college students were still having trouble practicing safe sex because there was not enough information out there to provide them with enough knowledge about what birth control methods were out there for them to use
        at their disposal.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Prototype 1</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br> However, after creating a prototype of a website with information about birth control methods and conducting a survey with people ages 18-30, talking more to my peers around me who were my target audience, and speaking with a health education
        and promotion coordinator at the UC Davis Health Education and Promotion department, I had a hunch that knowing about birth control methods was not necessarily the problem at stake when it comes to practicing safe sex but rather college students
        did not discuss or know how to discuss safe sex practices with their partners without it feeling "awkward or weird" or it "ruining the mood" before any sexual encounter.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Prototype 2</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br>I decided to gather some materials already available for UC Davis students to grab before I left the the UC Davis Health Education and Promotion department and rediscovered a safe sex booklet UC Davis actually handed out to me at my orientation.
        There was a lot of useful information inside about practicing safe sex, but some of the information was a bit outdated and sounded "awkward" for modern times and the booklet could use a huge upgrade in its design. I decided the best solution to
        normalizing the topic of sex and practicing safe sex in the college environment was to create a mini-magazine/booklet that could be distributed around campus and available to peruse at popular waiting areas.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Final Product</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br> After going through several edits of my booklet, I was able to condense, refine, rewrite, update, and redesign the booklet to appeal to my target audience and what information would be most important to them when it comes to practicing safe
        sex and communicating safe sex practices. I chose Avant Garde STD for a modern and fun font to keep their interest, included the most important information to my target audience, which was hand-picked by my target audience, and included new information
        about the new resources available to students now.
