      <br>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        In a design team of 4, including myself, we were tasked to design an interactive vinyl design that would form a narrative about what a building's enviornment was like inside while generating a reaction from users and observers of the building and utilizing
        its pre-existing archetectural environment to build upon the narrative.
        <br>
        <br> The concept for our design installation centers around the coffee lab located in Everson Hall. Everson Hall is the location of the textiles department, but we wanted to focus on the coffee lab because itâ€™s a lesser-known feature of campus.

      <br>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        We took pictures of the environment and began photoshopping possible designs onto the pictures to get a look and feel of the design we had in mind.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Vinyls</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br> We researched many coffee related phrases online that best suited the overall look and feeling we wanted our design to convey. After asking our peers who are advid coffee consumers as well, the phrase "Wake Up and Smell the Coffee" ended
        up best sending a calming and positive message to people who would interact and/or relate to the design the most. We chose the typefaces Steelworks Vintage Demo and SignPainter because we wanted the typography to have an old-fashioned feel of
        a local coffee shop. Our vinyl design was spray painted gold paint to stand out from the dark doorway and reflected metallic details often found on coffee bags.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Cup</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br> We decided to construct the cup with duct tape and cardboard. We decided to use orange colored matte duct tape because removing duct tape from the cement and stone surfaces later would be the cheapest method and easiest to remove later with least residue left behind in the environment. We specifically chose a matte orange colored duct tape because the bright color would draw attention to the installation and orange is a color that is used in coffee packaging. The cup handle was made of recycled cardboard and we used the left over orange duct tape to mask the cup handle so we do not waste materials.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Steam</h4>
      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        <br> We decided to a steam trail coming from the coffee cup by creating gradient grayscale rows of squares continuing off from the already pre-existing rectangle cut outs already on the wall.
