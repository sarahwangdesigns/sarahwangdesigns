      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        I wanted to challenge myself and redesign a food packaging that isn’t as popular and turn it into something more appealing. Therefore, I picked redesigning packaging for sunflower seeds. Sunflower seed packaging has not been changed for several years and I was curious to see what I could come up with in terms of perhaps making sunflower seed packaging or sunflower seed consumption, more trendy and modern. My approach on redesigning sunflower seed packing was that I realized that making sunflower seeds itself more trendy would be difficult, but making a trendier food packaging for sunflower seeds would make it seem more of a friendly and memorable food item.
      </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h4>Biomimicry</h4>
          <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
            <br> I choose sunflowers, sunflower seeds, and honeycomb to base the biomimicry of my packaging off of.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Logo</h4>
          <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
            <br>I chose to create a simple, clean, and modern logo containing a simple sunflower seed and a golden yellow circle to indicate the disk of a sunflower and/or a sun. I chose the font Memphis because it was as simple, easy, clean, yet a little rustic to match the idea of sunflower seeds, but in a modern way.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Prototype 1</h4>
          <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
            <br> My first prototype was based on the idea of recreating the look of a sunflower with how my packaging unfolded. I made a hexagonal tray to hold any sunflower seed shells as the base of the packaging and sunflower seed shaped to-go/portion controlled/snackable packages of sunflower seeds as tear-away foldable petals.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Feedback</h4>
          <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
            <br> My peers thought the idea was really creative and unique, however there was a problem of how it would sit on the shelf in stores and how that would work. Wrapping it in a saran wrap or plastic was an option, however it still did not sit or display how I would like it to.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Final Product</h4>
          <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
            <br> I brainstormed another design that could be a reusable container that holds the sunflower seed packets. The container would be hexagonal and tall and wide enough to hold 14 packets of to-go sunflower seed packets. The packets of sunflower seeds shaped like sunflower seeds would be organized in such a way it would look like fibonacci swirl just like the pattern a sunflower sprouts its seeds at its disk. By creating a hexagonal container, this would make for easy arrangement and by making it not so tall, it would allow for room to stack layers of the containers on top of each other if need be. The lid of the containers and packets of sunflower seeds would be color coded to indicate different flavors.

      <p id="aboutWorkDesc">
        Lastly, I fit the company’s mission statement on the outside of the lid for consumers to read and learn more about the company as that was identified by grocery shoppers as a deciding factor after price, quality, and brand in purchasing a food item.
