      Hello, my name is Sarah Wang and I am a recent graduate of the Class of 2017 at the University of California, Davis. I majored in Design with a focus on Graphic Design, Web Design, and Interaction Design. Dabbled and still dabbling in communication, marketing,
      and cognitive processes as a former undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego.
      <br>
      <br> As a designer and in general, I believe in working hard, persevering, and conquering your obstacles to achieve goals. I ideate, sketch, prototype, and user test everything I design because Iâ€™ve always been interested in how products or services
      are created and how products and services interact with people. My goal is to help a client or employer design highly functional visual designs from complex ideas by utilizing human- centered design strategies to create the best user experience
      possible.
      <br>
      <br> On a side note, I value finding balance and time to socialize to build solid relationships with the people around me. I believe that the stronger a design team and company can bond and be able to work together, better results will come from
      that. Coffee & tea or food adventures anyone?
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p id="signaturePrint">Cheers!</p>
